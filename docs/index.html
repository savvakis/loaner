Before you get those house keys, you‚Äôll need to sign loan documents and paperwork that transfers homeownership from the seller to you. Throughout your home purchase, third parties, as well as your lender, have performed services. <b>Closing costs are fees</b> these professionals charge for these services to finalize the real estate transaction and your home loan.</p><h3>How Much Are <u>Closing Costs</u>?</h3><p>Closing costs typically range from 2% to 5% of the property‚Äôs purchase price. Thus, if you buy a $200,000 house, your closing costs could range from $4,000 to $10,000. Closing fees vary depending on your state, loan type, and mortgage lender, so it‚Äôs <b>important</b> to pay close attention to these fees.</p><p>‚ÑπÔ∏è If you disable all closing costs then typically the savings input field acts like a down payment amount field.</p><h3>Happy mortgaging! üòÄ</h3></div><script src="main.a619a26c6c245b134705.js"></script></body></html>
